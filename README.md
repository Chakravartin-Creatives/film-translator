film-translator

AI-powered cinematic localization. Built by Chakravartin Creatives.

---

Purpose
To empower independent filmmakers with a seamless, AI-powered localization platform that makes global distribution frictionless, beautiful, and immersive — without bad dubs or distracting subtitles.

What It Does
**film-translator** is an online platform where filmmakers can:
- Upload high-resolution masters of their films.
- Automatically localize dialogue into any target language.
- Visually sync on-screen actors' lips/mouths to match new dialogue.
- Generate voice performances for each actor that match tone, gender, age, and performance style.
- Add off-screen voice ambience and background chatter in the local language.
- Adapt lighting, makeup tone, and color grading subtly to maintain emotional and cultural authenticity.

The Problem
Filmmakers face major barriers when distributing to international markets:
- Bad dubbing ruins immersion.
- Subtitles alienate some audiences.
- Budget and time constraints block high-quality multilingual post-production.

Our Solution
A single platform that lets you:
- Reach every market without losing nuance.
- Match local language and cultural tone on-screen.
- Avoid traditional dubbing studios and expensive reshoots.
- Retain your original creative vision — just optimized per region.

Proposed Features
- Secure film upload + encryption
- Auto scene segmentation + character detection
- Multilingual voice generation with actor matching
- Lip sync + mouth/face retiming
- AI-enhanced lighting and grade adaptation
- Review + manual tweak interface for directors
- Export for theatrical, VOD, and indie platforms

Tech Stack (Planned)
- Video/Audio: FFmpeg, Whisper, OpenFace, DeepWarp
- AI/ML: GPT-4V, ElevenLabs, custom actor-voice matching model
- Hosting: AWS/GCP
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Celery
- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind, WebRTC preview tools

Use Cases
- Distribute indie films globally
- Reach diasporas in their heritage language
- Seamless language availability for on-demand platforms
- Preserve immersion without expensive re-dubbing

Collaboration Invitation
Looking for:
- Machine learning researchers (audio-visual sync, face/voice modeling)
- Full-stack developers
- Indie filmmakers and post-production experts
- Language/culture consultants

Let's build a world where language is no longer a barrier to cinema.

"Film is universal. Now your distribution can be too."
